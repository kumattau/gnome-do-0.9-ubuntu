gnome-do (0.8.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * Imported Upstream version 0.8.5
    - Fix newline in Kazakh translation (Closes: #618415)
    - Fix build with mono >= 2.8.
  * Remove unneeded .la files. (Closes: #621335)
  * Drop patches included in new release
  * Use ‘dh --with’ rather than cli.make to avoid warning spam
  * Drop mention of Evolution from package description.
    - The evolution plugin is not going to be buildable for the forseeable
      future.  Including it in the package description is misleading.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Add missing dependency on librsvg2-common, required to load SVGs
    (Closes: #619039)
  * Update to use my d.o email address

gnome-do (0.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The long fortold release
    + Fixes a threadsafety issue resulting in 100% CPU usage (Closes: 565591,
      LP: #450852).
    + Proxies all keyring calls to the GTK main thread, as required by the new
      gnome-keyring (Closes: 603876, LP: #553643)
  * debian/patches/00_bundledlibs.dpatch:
  * debian/rules:
    + Upstream has dropped bundled gmcs binary; now 100% DFSG-free, so we don't
      have to repack the tarball or patch the buildsystem.
  * debian/patches/03_disable_docky.dpatch:
    + Drop.  Docky is now gone in the upstream tarball.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/control:
  * debian/patches/*:
    + Switch to quilt to harmonise with other pkg-cli-* packages.
  * debian/control:
    + Drop recommends on gnome-do-docklets.  Docky is now a separate package,
      so the docklets are useless for Do.
    + Bump Breaks on gnome-do-plugins to 0.8.3.  Do no longer provides the Wink
      library, which has been imported into the 0.8.3 do-plugins sources.
    + Bump standards-version; no changes needed.
    + Migrate to git and update VCS fields appropriately

gnome-do (0.8.3.1+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/03_disable_docky.dpatch: Add patch to disable Docky
    theme as this is now distributed as a separate project, in the docky
    package.
  * debian/patches/04_dont_disable_deprecated.dpatch: Add patch to not
    build with *DISABLE_DEPRECATED. libdo uses deprecated symbols and
    FTBFS with these flags set. It's wrong to set them in release tarballs
    anyway.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Add dh-autoreconf to autoreconf in the
    build in order to pick up the above patches.

    + Transition to -cil-dev packages for Build-Dependends.

  * debian/rules:
    + Use mono-csc instead of csc for MCS
    + Pass -f -i to autoreconf to keep the buildsystem's libtool in sync
      with Debian's.  Fixes libtool-related FTBFS (Closes: #560645)
    + Apply ltmain-add-as-needed.patch after autoreconf-ing for --as-needed
      magic.
    + Pass --as-needed to the linker to eliminate dependencies on unneeded 
      libs.
  * debian/README.source:
    + Add to really comply with policy; we've got a patch system!
  * debian/ltmain-add-as-needed.patch:
    + Patch to add --as-needed magic to ltmain.sh

gnome-do (0.6.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New upstream release
